**Description**
I have created a personal portfolio to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements as a budding web developer. This portfolio consists of five HTML pages, each designed with a clear purpose:
1)Home – Introduction and navigation to other pages.
2)About Me – Highlights my background, skills, and interests.
3)Projects – Displays my coding and web development projects.
4)Skills – Showcases my technical skills and tools.
5)Contact – Provides ways for visitors to reach me.
The portfolio demonstrates my knowledge of HTML and CSS, clean structuring, responsive design, and interactive navigation. I really enjoyed building this project under CODSOFT, as it allowed me to express my creativity and present myself professionally online.

**Features**
1)Interactive navigation between all pages.
2)Clean and consistent design with strong color contrasts.
3)Structured layout for easy readability and accessibility.
4)Showcases personal projects, skills, and contact information.
